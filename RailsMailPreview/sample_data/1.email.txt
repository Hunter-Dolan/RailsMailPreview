0. Introduction

I don't know about you, but August was a pretty good month for me.

Some highlights:

- I met a ton of customers at HostingCon in San Diego.
- I figured out what I'm going to be for Halloween.
- I attended a "toptional" pool at a Las Vegas bachelor party.  Twice.
- I watched a sizable chunk of our staff leave for Burning Man.
- I got our CEO to finally admit that he speaks dolphin.

My plans for September look even better:

- I'll move and change change my name.
- I'll spend too much money on something I'll only wear once.
- I'll make sure that every photo I took in Las Vegas has been deleted.
- I'll hide certain coworkers on Facebook so I don't have to look at
  their junk.
- I'll get our CEO to schmooze the Dolphin King to reveal the location
  of the secret dolphin treasure - the Golden Herring.

This promises be a pretty busy month for me; one fraught with peril,
intrigue, and acts of derring-do.  I know it sounds exciting and you
probably want to help, but some things a man just has to do on his own.

It's like I told the girl at the toptional pool: "You're an active, I'm
a sedentary.  It would never work out."

1. Simon Says... (Written by CEO Simon Anderson!)

Welcome to September. A month of new beginnings for kids all over the
northern hemisphere going back to school. And the tail end of winter in
the southern climes. One of the best things about being a part of
DreamHost is knowing that we serve customers all over the world. From
Brazil to Canada, China to Morocco. All pursuing your dreams on the web,
whether that's a passion project blog, a web store that knows no
boundaries, or a heavy duty web application or site that's going to
change an industry.

We're excited that last month, we achieved a big milestone - serving
300,000 customers for the first time in our long and techy-creative
history. We celebrated in true DreamHost style with a simple cake then
a chocolate fueled ping pong match. Then we got back to work, because
there's a lot of you and lots to do!

Since joining DreamHost in July, I've been getting to know the team and
figuring out ways to take the awesome company and culture that's been
built, and make it even more focused on your success as customers. We've
made some changes to the way we handle Tech Support call backs this
month that I think you're going to like.  Our Tech Support team are the
true legends of DreamHost, working day and night to help you use our
services better and solve problems that come up quickly and with a fun
attitude. Make sure you give them some props (and jokes) when you next
have to email, chat or take a call. We're also in the process of going
through all our FAQs and updating them to ensure you get the answers
you need, fast!

We're always vigilant when it comes to platform stability, and we have
had some issues on a few shared servers lately with drives failing and
restores taking time to complete, resulting in degraded performance for
the affected sites. Our Ops and Sys Admin teams have identified ways to
mitigate hardware failures and speed resolution, so I'm confident we'll
see fewer of these issues going forward. And with over 4,000 servers
running 24/7, we've architected our systems so that hardware failures
affect as few customers as possible. If you've experienced any issues
and want to check that you're on the best account type for your web
resource needs (shared, VPS or dedicated server), our support team is
always happy to step you through the options.

In the end, running a business like DreamHost is all about agility. How
fast can we get your account provisioned; how rapidly can we respond to
your support request; how quickly can we implement support for a new
framework or add a new app on our platform. Agile is a methodology that
is well known and practiced by leading software development teams around
the world, including our team of 25+ developers at DreamHost. But here
at DreamHost, we're extending it to the whole organization, from
Marketing to DevOps and Support. It's an approach that I think brings
out the best in any team. Openness, transparency, authenticity, and
attacking big challenges in small chunks with a fast moving attitude and
the ability to course-correct as new ideas or information comes in.=20

So as you build your business or personal project on the web with
DreamHost, know that we take our responsibility to all 300,000 of you
very seriously, with a touch of irreverence and wacky humor. And to
steal a line from a classic 80's movie, we feel the need, the need for
speed - in everything we do.

@DreamHostSimon

Best,
Simon

2. New Website (Back to Brett!)

As a DreamHost customer you have little reason to visit our website at
http://www.dreamhost.com.

Why would you?  That's the front door.  You're already in the front
door.

No sir, you take the back door.  It doesn't matter what time of day or
night it may be, it's back door entry all the way for you!  You conduct
your business at http://panel.dreamhost.com/ and you like it.

You may be interested, then, to learn that the front door has gotten a
fresh coat of paint and some new window treatments.  That's right,
dreamhost.com is all-new.

For the first time in our 14 year history we hired an external design
agency to build our website - and it's never looked better.

Hold on to your hats and cover your head holes because I'm about to
blow your mind in six words: Dreamhost.com is now powered by WordPress.

WordPress these days is so customizable and extensible that when it
came time for us to switch away from static HTML files and onto a
content management system, WordPress was the only platform we seriously
considered.

Do you know who got stuck designing and redesigning dreamhost.com for
the last decade?  Me.

Do you have any idea how good it feels to be able to throw money at a
problem and have it disappear?  There are no words.  Only tears of joy.

Learn more about the whys and the whos at...

########################################################################
3. One-Hour Callbacks

As a hosting company we can say with great confidence that providing
technical support is not an inexpensive endeavor.  In fact, it's one of
our largest expenses.

Once you buy a rack of servers, that's it.  The money's spent.  Hardware
comes with warranties.  Electricity and network costs are minimal.
Hardware generally doesn't die...often.

PEOPLE, on the other hand, are hugely inefficient.  They need health
insurance.  They need air conditioning.  They need ongoing product
education.  They need toilet paper in the bathroom.  They need "safe
working conditions."

All of these things cost money, which is why most companies who offer
any kind of technical support look to cut corners wherever they can.
They might outsource.  They might understaff themselves.

They might just stop caring!

We've managed to keep our support costs down by providing telephone-
based technical support only to customers who plan to use it and elect
to pay a little bit extra for it.

Phone support comes in the form of callbacks from our technical support
team - and you specify the time that we call.

Until recently we asked you to provide us with a three-hour window in
which to reach you.  Unfortunately, we've seen that people just don't
trust service delivery windows.  Thanks a lot, cable companies!

So we've tightened things up a bit around here and we're happy to say
that, Monday through Friday, callbacks can now be requested down to the
hour.

http://blog.dreamhost.com/2011/08/30/long-time-hoster-first-time-caller/

If you're seeking satisfaction and looking for a good time on the phone,
DreamHost Support is cheaper than other types of phone hotlines and
won't leave you filled with shame and regret when you hang up.

I mean...I've I heard that happens.

Somebody told me.

...

What?  What's with the look?

########################################################################
4. HostingCon Wrapup

We sent more-employees-than-was-probably-a-good-idea down to San Diego
in August to attend HostingCon, a hosting industry event where the focus
was on networking, deal making, and a large collection of
disappointingly light-on-details and not-at-all-funny conference
sessions.

The good news is that WE were there so things never got TOO lame.

For starters, we threw a party!

http://blog.dreamhost.com/2011/08/13/what-you-missed-at-hostingcon-2011/

Along with all the usual industry people, YOU were invited!  And, in
fact, meeting customers was the highlight of the evening for me.  I feel
like we've never been closer!

...especially after one of you lady-types goosed me and ran out the
door.

Here's what you missed out on!

http://www.flickr.com/photos/dreamhost/sets/72157627463454112/

We also livened up the streets of downtown San Diego by turning what the
locals consider to be a nuisance into a fleet of beautiful, rideable,
moving billboards.

http://blog.dreamhost.com/2011/08/18/pedal-powered-hosting/

As great as it was to meet with all those analysts, reporters, vendors,
and even competitors for one crazy week in August, meeting with
customers was the one activity that brought our team the most joy and
insight.

You guys are everything to us.

You're the sun to our moon.

The gin to our tonic.

The fiddle to our faddle.

I guess what I'm saying is we kind of have a thing for you and we want
to hang out more often!

Stay tuned...

########################################################################
4. New Charity: Dream Foundation

June through August we solicited donations for Project C.U.R.E., whose
mission of helping to provide medical supplies and equipment to medical
personnel and health care professionals around the world...seemed good.

http://www.projectcure.org/

21 of our kindest customers raised $603.00 for Project C.U.R.E. which
we then matched three times over for a grand total of $2412.00!

Our next donation target is...

Dream Foundation
http://www.dreamfoundation.org/

"Dream Foundation helps adults find peace and closure with the
realization of a final wish. Dream Foundation has granted thousands of
dreams to adults who are emotionally, financially and physically
devastated by terminal illness."

They won't just come out and say it, so I'll say it for them:
Dream Foundation is Make-A-Wish for grown-ups.

How great is that?

Contracting a terminal illness is one of the worst things that could
happen to anybody.

But learning that you've missed the Make-A-Wish bus by a few YEARS just
because you got older?  That's devastating.

So now I have a plan B.  If and when "The Big C" comes callin' my name,
the Black Eyed Peas are going to have the BEST FIFTH MEMBER EVER:
"b.rock"

You can submit donations to Dream Foundation (which we'll then
quadruple, as always!) from the "Give to Charity" section of your
account control panel:

https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=3Dhome.charity

########################################################################
6. DreamHost 101: Free Whois Privacy

The thing about registering domain names is that you're supposed to
provide your own legit contact information when you do it.  Full name,
address, phone number, email address, blood type, cheek swab, dental
records, sexual preference, credit score - the works.

All of that information (most of it) is then immediately put into the
public record where it's viewable to anyone who cares to look it up
through a registrar's "whois" tool.

After registering a domain you'll immediately start to get more spam in
your inbox, more junk mail in your "other" inbox, and your life will
generally not be as hassle-free as it would have been otherwise.  All
because you registered some dumb domain name!  Sheesh!

You COULD just falsify your contact information, but that would put you
at risk of having the domain taken away from you if anyone ever noticed.

That's quite a pickle!

To help ease your pain we offer a whois Privacy Service - FREE.

We will provide a valid mailing address, phone number, and email address
for your domain's registration record.

We'll list "yourdomainname.com@proxy.dreamhost.com" and forward its
messages to your true hidden email address.

We'll even accept and recycle all junk mail on your behalf!

There really is no good reason not to do it.

To enable or disable domain privacy, just visit the
"Domains/Registrations" section of your account control panel, click a
domain name, click to modify its "whois" info, and there you go -
instant privacy.

https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=3Ddomain.registration

But seriously, are you going to eat that pickle?

</p>

<p>
This promises be a pretty busy month for me; one fraught with peril,
intrigue, and acts of derring-do.  I know it sounds exciting and you
probably want to help, but some things a man just has to do on his own.
</p>

<p>
It's like I told the girl at the toptional pool: "You're an active, I'm
a sedentary.  It would never work out."

r>
<tr><td>

<p>
Welcome to September. A month of new beginnings for kids all over the
northern hemisphere going back to school. And the tail end of winter in
the southern climes. One of the best things about being a part of
DreamHost is knowing that we serve customers all over the world. From
Brazil to Canada, China to Morocco. All pursuing your dreams on the web,
whether that's a passion project blog, a web store that knows no
boundaries, or a heavy duty web application or site that's going to
change an industry.
</p>

<p>
We're excited that last month, we achieved a big milestone - serving
300,000 customers for the first time in our long and techy-creative
history. We celebrated in true DreamHost style with a simple cake then
a chocolate fueled ping pong match. Then we got back to work, because
there's a lot of you and lots to do!
</p>

<p>
Since joining DreamHost in July, I've been getting to know the team and
figuring out ways to take the awesome company and culture that's been
built, and make it even more focused on your success as customers. We've
made some changes to the way we handle Tech Support call backs this
month that I think you're going to like.  Our Tech Support team are the
true legends of DreamHost, working day and night to help you use our
services better and solve problems that come up quickly and with a fun
attitude. Make sure you give them some props (and jokes) when you next
have to email, chat or take a call. We're also in the process of going
through all our FAQs and updating them to ensure you get the answers
you need, fast!
</p>

<p>
We're always vigilant when it comes to platform stability, and we have
had some issues on a few shared servers lately with drives failing and
restores taking time to complete, resulting in degraded performance for
the affected sites. Our Ops and Sys Admin teams have identified ways to
mitigate hardware failures and speed resolution, so I'm confident we'll
see fewer of these issues going forward. And with over 4,000 servers
running 24/7, we've architected our systems so that hardware failures
affect as few customers as possible. If you've experienced any issues
and want to check that you're on the best account type for your web
resource needs (shared, VPS or dedicated server), our support team is
always happy to step you through the options.
</p>

<p>
In the end, running a business like DreamHost is all about agility. How
fast can we get your account provisioned; how rapidly can we respond to
your support request; how quickly can we implement support for a new
framework or add a new app on our platform. Agile is a methodology that
is well known and practiced by leading software development teams around
the world, including our team of 25+ developers at DreamHost. But here
at DreamHost, we're extending it to the whole organization, from
Marketing to DevOps and Support. It's an approach that I think brings
out the best in any team. Openness, transparency, authenticity, and
attacking big challenges in small chunks with a fast moving attitude and
the ability to course-correct as new ideas or information comes in.=20
</p>

<p>
So as you build your business or personal project on the web with
DreamHost, know that we take our responsibility to all 300,000 of you
very seriously, with a touch of irreverence and wacky humor. And to
steal a line from a classic 80's movie, we feel the need, the need for
speed - in everything we do.

Hold on to your hats and cover your head holes because I'm about to
blow your mind in six words: Dreamhost.com is now powered by WordPress.

WordPress these days is so customizable and extensible that when it
came time for us to switch away from static HTML files and onto a

considered.

Do you know who got stuck designing and redesigning dreamhost.com for

<p>
As a hosting company we can say with great confidence that providing
technical support is not an inexpensive endeavor.  In fact, it's one of
our largest expenses.
</p>

<p>
Once you buy a rack of servers, that's it.  The money's spent.  Hardware
comes with warranties.  Electricity and network costs are minimal.
Hardware generally doesn't die...often.
</p>

<p>
PEOPLE, on the other hand, are hugely inefficient.  They need health
insurance.  They need air conditioning.  They need ongoing product
education.  They need toilet paper in the bathroom.  They need "safe
working conditions."
</p>

<p>
All of these things cost money, which is why most companies who offer
any kind of technical support look to cut corners wherever they can.
They might outsource.  They might understaff themselves.
</p>

<p>
They might just stop caring!
</p>

<p>
We've managed to keep our support costs down by providing telephone-
based technical support only to customers who plan to use it and elect
to pay a little bit extra for it.
</p>

<p>
Phone support comes in the form of callbacks from our technical support
team - and you specify the time that we call.
</p>

<p>
Until recently we asked you to provide us with a three-hour window in
which to reach you.  Unfortunately, we've seen that people just don't
trust service delivery windows.  Thanks a lot, cable companies!
</p>

<p>
So we've tightened things up a bit around here and we're happy to say
that, Monday through Friday, callbacks can now be requested down to the
hour.
</p>

If you're seeking satisfaction and looking for a good time on the phone,
DreamHost Support is cheaper than other types of phone hotlines and

I mean...I've I heard that happens.

We sent more-employees-than-was-probably-a-good-idea down to San Diego
in August to attend HostingCon, a hosting industry event where the focus
was on networking, deal making, and a large collection of
disappointingly light-on-details and not-at-all-funny conference
sessions.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that WE were there so things never got TOO lame.
</p>

<p>
For starters, we threw a party!

<p>
June through August we solicited donations for Project C.U.R.E., whose
mission of helping to provide medical supplies and equipment to medical
personnel and health care professionals around the world...seemed good.
</p>

<p><span class=3D"fancylink">

<p>
21 of our kindest customers raised $603.00 for Project C.U.R.E. which
we then matched three times over for a grand total of $2412.00!
</p>

<p>
Our next donation target is...

<p>
"Dream Foundation helps adults find peace and closure with the
realization of a final wish. Dream Foundation has granted thousands of
dreams to adults who are emotionally, financially and physically
devastated by terminal illness."
</p>

<p>
They won't just come out and say it, so I'll say it for them:
Dream Foundation is Make-A-Wish for grown-ups.
</p>

<p>
How great is that?
</p>

<p>
Contracting a terminal illness is one of the worst things that could
happen to anybody.
</p>

<p>
But learning that you've missed the Make-A-Wish bus by a few YEARS just
because you got older?  That's devastating.
</p>

<p>
So now I have a plan B.  If and when "The Big C" comes callin' my name,
the Black Eyed Peas are going to have the BEST FIFTH MEMBER EVER:

<tr><td>

<p>
The thing about registering domain names is that you're <em>supposed</em>=
 to
provide your own legit contact information when you do it.  Full name,
address, phone number, email address, blood type, cheek swab, dental
records, sexual preference, credit score - the works.
</p>

<p>
All of that information (most of it) is then immediately put into the
public record where it's viewable to anyone who cares to look it up
through a registrar's "whois" tool.
</p>

<p>
After registering a domain you'll immediately start to get more spam in
your inbox, more junk mail in your "other" inbox, and your life will
generally not be as hassle-free as it would have been otherwise.  All
because you registered some dumb domain name!  Sheesh!
</p>

<p>
You COULD just falsify your contact information, but that would put you
at risk of having the domain taken away from you if anyone ever noticed.
</p>

<p>
That's quite a pickle!
</p>

<p>
To help ease your pain we offer a whois Privacy Service - FREE.
</p>

<p>
We will provide a valid mailing address, phone number, and email address
for your domain's registration record.
</p>

<p>
We'll list "yourdomainname.com@proxy.dreamhost.com" and forward its
messages to your true hidden email address.
</p>

<p>
We'll even accept and recycle all junk mail on your behalf!
</p>

<p>
There really is no good reason not to do it.
</p>

<p>
To enable or disable domain privacy, just visit the
"Domains/Registrations" section of your account control panel, click a
domain name, click to modify its "whois" info, and there you go -
instant privacy.
