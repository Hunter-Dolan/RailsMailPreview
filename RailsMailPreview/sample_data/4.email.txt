Summary: A new screencast, a new series, and comic books!

++++ Meet Rails 3 Parts I & II ++++

Part II of our introductory Rails 3 series has been published! If you're learning Rails for the first time, this two part series will teach you the basics of Rails in under three hours.

    https://peepcode.com/products/meet-rails-3-i

    https://peepcode.com/products/meet-rails-3-ii

The demand for Rails developers around the world is intense. Our first videos on Rails helped thousands of developers get their groove on with Rails. This series continues that tradition.

Part II runs for 90 action-packed minutes where youâll learn to use Railsâ packaging and code generation tools, work with stylesheets and JavaScript files, link data models together, and build powerful controllers in only a few lines. Youâll learn to build forms and organize view templates for easy reuse and maintenance.

âGreat work on Rails 3 pt. II. You've really helped to decrease the learning curve.â 
- George Gilmer

âI purchased the two 'Meet Rails 3' screencasts and I must say that they were very well organized, easy to follow and to the point! After watching the screencasts I was able to continue programming my web app at least twice as fast as before. Well done! Definitely worth the money, and I will gladly purchase any more advanced Rails 3 screencasts.â 
- Alex Nikolaidis

++++ Play by Play with Gary Bernhardt ++++

We love to watch developers at work. It's a great way to pick up workflow tips, shell shortcuts, and text editor optimizations.

This screencast is part of a new series at PeepCode where we sit down with expert programmers and build a simple project. You wonât learn a specific topic or build a deployable product, but youâll pick up workflow tips and editor hacks that usually require years of experience to figure out.

In this episode, we will learn tips and tricks from our friend and development guru Gary Bernhardt. Topics covered include Ruby, Git, RSpec, Vim, the terminal, and test-driven development.

âGreat video! The TDD and Git info you share far exceeds the cost of video. Highly recommended.â 
- Matt Margolis via Twitter

âAll kinds of awesome in this PeepCode screencast featuring Gary Bernhardt.â 
- James Martin via Twitter

âIf you have a couple bucks, I'd totally suggest that you buy this Play by Play screencast, what a great idea!â 
- Federico Builes

++++ The Blog ++++

After a brief hiatus, the PeepCode blog is charged up and ready to spin. We had a lot of fun recreating a classic comic book to talk about new syntax in Ruby 1.9:
